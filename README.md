# RL_Monkey

In this project, a reinforcement learning agent learns to navigate its environment through use of Q-learning with an epsilon-greedy policy.

The game being played is called SwingyMonkey, which can be played with the pygame module. To play the game, install pygame and then run the file SwingyMonkey.py. To see one version of Q-learning, run stub_1.py or stub_2.py (and choose whether or not to see visuals of the monkey training by commenting or uncommenting that line of code at the top of either file). stub_2.py generally performs better.

The results for monkey 1 and monkey 2 (trained in stub_1.py and stub_2.py, respectively) can be observed above. Monkey 1
